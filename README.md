# My React Portfolio

## Description

This Portfolio is my first attempt with react to create a personal portfolio in the form of a web page with a functioning animated layout that has links to an about me section, Skills, My Portfolio, and my Resume as well as links to any of my social media. This was my first time really going all out with react, I had a lot of help with resources but I am happy with the end product!
